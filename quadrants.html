          <p class="lead">A simple way to decide what to do now, what to plan, what to hand off, and what to skip.</p>
        </div>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Do First (Urgent + Important)</h2>
        <p>
          These tasks are time-sensitive and meaningful. If you delay them, there is a real consequence, like missing a
          deadline, paying a fee, or letting something important get worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep this list short. If everything lands here, your system stops helping and turns into a stress list.
        </p>
        <h3>How to decide if a task belongs here</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It has a near deadline and the outcome truly matters.</li>
          <li>Waiting would cause a clear problem.</li>
          <li>You cannot reasonably delegate it right now.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mixed-life examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paying a bill due today</li>
          <li>Submitting an assignment tonight</li>
          <li>Calling the vet about a pet issue</li>
          <li>Fixing a broken work deliverable before a meeting</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What to do with tasks in this quadrant:</strong> Handle these first in focused blocks, one by one.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Schedule (Not Urgent + Important)</h2>
        <p>
          These tasks support your long-term goals and quality of life, but they are easy to postpone because nothing is
          on fire yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where progress happens: planning, health, learning, and relationship upkeep all usually live here.
        </p>
        <h3>How to decide if a task belongs here</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It matters, even if there is no immediate deadline.</li>
          <li>Doing it consistently would improve your week or month.</li>
          <li>It can be planned on a calendar instead of done immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mixed-life examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Meal planning for the week</li>
          <li>Studying for a test next week</li>
          <li>Booking an annual checkup</li>
          <li>Writing a project plan before execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What to do with tasks in this quadrant:</strong> Put them on your calendar with a real date and time.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Delegate (Urgent + Not Important)</h2>
        <p>
          These tasks feel pressing, but they do not require your specific skills or attention. They still need to get
          done, just not necessarily by you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delegation can mean asking family, classmates, teammates, or even using simple automation when appropriate.
        </p>
        <h3>How to decide if a task belongs here</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is time-sensitive but low-value for your goals.</li>
          <li>Someone else could do it at similar quality.</li>
          <li>Keeping it would crowd out more important work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mixed-life examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Asking a sibling to grab groceries</li>
          <li>Having a teammate format slides</li>
          <li>Forwarding admin paperwork to the right person</li>
          <li>Assigning routine follow-up calls</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What to do with tasks in this quadrant:</strong> Hand them off clearly and set a check-in point.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Eliminate (Not Urgent + Not Important)</h2>
        <p>
          These tasks do not move your priorities forward and are not truly required. Most are distractions or habits
          that sneak into your day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Removing even a few of these creates space for calmer days and better attention.
        </p>
        <h3>How to decide if a task belongs here</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It has no meaningful impact if skipped.</li>
          <li>It is mostly avoidance or busywork.</li>
          <li>You added it out of guilt, not priority.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mixed-life examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-checking apps every few minutes</li>
          <li>Reorganizing files with no active use</li>
          <li>Arguing in comment threads</li>
          <li>Optional errands that can wait indefinitely</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What to do with tasks in this quadrant:</strong> Drop them, mute them, or park them for later review.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Everything feels urgent:</strong> stress can blur your judgment, so check actual deadlines.</li>
          <li><strong>Important vs urgent gets mixed up:</strong> urgency is about time pressure; importance is about impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Overfilling Do First:</strong> keep only true priorities there.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring Schedule:</strong> skipped planning creates future emergencies.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>Quick checklist</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Does this have a real near deadline?</li>
          <li>Does it matter to my goals, health, finances, or relationships?</li>
          <li>Can someone else do it well enough?</li>
          <li>What happens if I do nothing this week?</li>
          <li>Where does it fit now: Do First, Schedule, Delegate, or Eliminate?</li>
