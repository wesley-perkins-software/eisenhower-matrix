      <section class="content-card" id="do-first">
        <h2>Do First</h2>
        <p><strong>Urgent + Important</strong></p>
        <p>These tasks are time-sensitive and high impact. Delaying them can create real problems.</p>
        <p>Keep this list short. If everything lands here, it stops being useful and starts feeling like a stress list.</p>
        <h3>How to spot it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It has a near deadline and the outcome truly matters.</li>
          <li>Waiting would cause a clear problem.</li>
          <li>You cannot reasonably delegate it right now.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paying a bill due today</li>
          <li>Submitting an assignment tonight</li>
          <li>Calling the vet about a pet issue</li>
          <li>Fixing a broken work deliverable before a meeting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If this line feels blurry, learn the difference between
          <a href="urgent-vs-important.html">urgent vs important</a> before sorting.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Do these next, one at a time, in focused blocks.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card" id="schedule">
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p><strong>Not Urgent + Important</strong></p>
        <p>These tasks support long-term goals and quality of life, but they are easy to postpone.</p>
        <p>This is where steady progress happens: planning, health, learning, and relationship upkeep.</p>
        <h3>How to spot it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It matters, even if there is no immediate deadline.</li>
          <li>Doing it consistently would improve your week or month.</li>
          <li>It can be planned on a calendar instead of done immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Meal planning for the week</li>
          <li>Studying for a test next week</li>
          <li>Booking an annual checkup</li>
          <li>Writing a project plan before execution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Need ideas? <a href="examples.html">See examples of Schedule tasks</a> and adapt them to your week.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Put these on your calendar with a real date and time.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card" id="delegate">
        <h2>Delegate</h2>
        <p><strong>Urgent + Not Important</strong></p>
        <p>These tasks feel pressing, but they do not need your specific attention.</p>
        <p>They still need to get done, just not necessarily by you.</p>
        <h3>How to spot it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It is time-sensitive but low-value for your goals.</li>
          <li>Someone else could do it at similar quality.</li>
          <li>Keeping it would crowd out more important work.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Asking a sibling to grab groceries</li>
          <li>Having a teammate format slides</li>
          <li>Forwarding admin paperwork to the right person</li>
          <li>Assigning routine follow-up calls</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Hand these off clearly and set a check-in.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card" id="eliminate">
        <h2>Eliminate</h2>
        <p><strong>Not Urgent + Not Important</strong></p>
        <p>These tasks do not move your priorities forward and are rarely required.</p>
        <p>Removing even a few creates more space, focus, and calm in your day.</p>
        <h3>How to spot it</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It has no meaningful impact if skipped.</li>
          <li>It is mostly avoidance or busywork.</li>
          <li>You added it out of guilt, not priority.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-checking apps every few minutes</li>
          <li>Reorganizing files with no active use</li>
          <li>Arguing in comment threads</li>
          <li>Optional errands that can wait indefinitely</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Drop, mute, or park these for later.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-card" id="mistakes">
        <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Everything feels urgent:</strong> stress can blur your judgment, so check actual deadlines.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Important vs urgent gets mixed up:</strong> urgency is about time pressure, while importance is about
            impact. See <a href="urgent-vs-important.html">urgent vs important explained</a>.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Overfilling Do First:</strong> keep only true priorities there.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring Schedule:</strong> skipped planning creates future emergencies.</li>
        </ul>

          <div>

          <div>
            <dt>What if a task seems urgent but isn’t important?</dt>
