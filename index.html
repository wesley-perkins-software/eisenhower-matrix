        <h2>What is the Eisenhower Matrix?</h2>
        <p>
          The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple priority matrix that helps with task prioritization by separating what is
          urgent vs important. It is a practical time management approach that turns a long list into four clear
          categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          This productivity tool keeps the method lightweight: add tasks, place them into a quadrant, and focus on what
          matters first. There is no sign up, and your list stays on this device.
        </p>

        <h2>The 4 quadrants</h2>
        <div class="quadrant-guide">
          <div>
            <h3>Do First (Urgent + Important)</h3>
            <p>
              These tasks need attention soon and have real impact. They are time-sensitive and meaningful, so they
              should be handled first.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reply to a time-sensitive request</li>
              <li>Pay a bill due today</li>
              <li>Finish an assignment due soon</li>
              <li>Resolve a work issue with a deadline</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quadrant-action">Focus here to reduce immediate pressure.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Schedule (Not Urgent + Important)</h3>
            <p>
              These tasks matter, but they are not urgent yet. Planning them protects your long-term goals.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Plan the next week</li>
              <li>Work on a long-term project</li>
              <li>Build a learning habit</li>
              <li>Book a routine appointment</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quadrant-action">Put these on your calendar so they happen.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Delegate (Urgent + Not Important)</h3>
            <p>
              These tasks feel urgent but do not require your specific attention. If possible, share or delegate them.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Schedule a meeting you do not need to lead</li>
              <li>Handle a routine request</li>
              <li>Respond to a non-critical message</li>
              <li>Follow up on a standard form or document</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quadrant-action">Ask for help or set a simple handoff.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Eliminate (Not Urgent + Not Important)</h3>
            <p>
              These tasks add little value and can distract from what matters. Consider removing them or saving them for
              later if they are optional.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Optional tasks with no clear benefit</li>
              <li>Low-value notifications to check</li>
              <li>Busywork that does not move goals forward</li>
              <li>Tasks you added without a clear reason</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quadrant-action">Let these go and make space.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>How to use this tool</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Add tasks quickly so they are out of your head and in one place.</li>
          <li>Decide if each task is urgent, important, both, or neither.</li>
          <li>Drag tasks into the matching quadrant.</li>
          <li>Give “Schedule” items a specific date or time.</li>
          <li>Delegate or simplify tasks that are urgent but not important.</li>
          <li>Review the list regularly and clear completed tasks.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Urgent vs important: what’s the difference?</h2>
        <p>
          Urgent tasks are time-sensitive and need attention soon. Important tasks support your goals, responsibilities,
          or wellbeing. The Eisenhower Matrix helps you act quickly where needed while protecting time for what matters.

          <dt>What is a priority matrix?</dt>
          <dd>A priority matrix is a simple way to organize tasks based on urgency and importance. The Eisenhower Matrix is one of the most well-known priority matrix methods.</dd>
          <dt>How do I decide where a task belongs?</dt>
          <dd>Ask two questions: does this need attention soon, and does it meaningfully matter? Your answers will guide which quadrant the task belongs in.</dd>
          <dt>What should I do with tasks that feel urgent but are not important?</dt>
          <dd>If possible, delegate them to someone else. If delegation is not an option, simplify or limit the time you spend on them.</dd>
          <dt>What belongs in the “Schedule” quadrant?</dt>
          <dd>Important tasks that are not urgent yet, such as planning, learning, health routines, or long-term projects, belong in “Schedule.”</dd>
          <dt>Can I print or export my matrix?</dt>
          <dd>This tool does not include built-in print or export features. You can copy tasks manually if you need to save or share them elsewhere.</dd>
          <dt>How often should I review my matrix?</dt>
          <dd>Review it whenever your priorities change. Many people find a daily or weekly review helpful.</dd>
          <dt>Is this based on the Eisenhower Matrix method?</dt>
          <dd>Yes. This tool is based on the classic urgent vs important framework, presented in a simple and distraction-free format.</dd>
          <dt>How do I clear everything and start over?</dt>
          <dd>Use the “Clear all tasks” button at the top of the page. This removes all tasks saved on this device.</dd>
