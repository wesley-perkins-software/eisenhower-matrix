        <h2>Simple difference</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Urgent</strong> tasks demand attention soon. They usually come with deadlines, alerts, or immediate
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important</strong> tasks support what actually matters to you: health, finances, relationships,
          learning, and meaningful work.
        </p>
        <p>
          A task can be urgent and important, just urgent, just important, or neither. That is exactly why the
          Eisenhower Matrix works.
