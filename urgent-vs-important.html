        <h2>Simple difference</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Urgent</strong> tasks demand attention soon. They usually come with deadlines, alerts, or immediate
          consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important</strong> tasks support what actually matters to you: health, finances, relationships,
          learning, and meaningful work.
        </p>
        <p>
          A task can be urgent and important, just urgent, just important, or neither. That is exactly why the
          Eisenhower Matrix works.
        </p>

      <section class="content-card">
        <h2>The 2-question test</h2>
        <p>To classify tasks quickly, ask:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Is there real time pressure (today/this week)?</li>
          <li>Does it meaningfully affect my goals or responsibilities?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If both answers are yes, place it in <strong>Do First</strong>. If only importance is yes, <strong>Schedule</strong> it. If only urgency is yes,
          <strong>Delegate</strong> it. If neither is yes, <strong>Eliminate</strong> it. See the full
          <a class="inline-link" href="quadrants.html">quadrants guide</a> for details.
